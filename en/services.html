          <p>
            When someone searches on Google or Bing, they already have a specific need.
            They are not browsing. They are comparing. They are deciding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our work is not about pushing ads everywhere.
            It’s about showing up at the moment the decision is being made.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            That’s why we focus exclusively on search-based visibility,
            where demand already exists.

          <p>
            Your visibility is built using targeted Google Search Ads campaigns.
            This is the foundation of the service and what the initial setup covers.

            Campaigns are structured to protect your brand name,
            clearly represent your main services,

            Google Ads is not used here to push advertising,
