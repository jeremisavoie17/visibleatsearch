          <p>
            When someone searches on Google or Bing, they already have a specific need.
            They are not browsing. They are comparing. They are deciding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our work is not about pushing ads everywhere.
            It’s about showing up when that decision is happening - based on real intent.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            That’s why we focus on search-based visibility only - where demand already exists.

          <p>
            Your visibility is built using targeted Google Search Ads campaigns.
            This is the foundation of the service and what the initial setup covers.

            We structure campaigns so that your brand name is protected, your main services are clearly represented,

            Google Ads is not used here to “push” advertising.

          <p>

          </p>

          <h3>Step 2 - Startup form</h3>
          <p>
            The email includes a link to a short startup form you can complete at your own pace.
            We ask for your business name, services offered, target area, and priorities (calls, forms, emails).
          </p>

          <h3>Step 3 - Analysis and setup</h3>
          <p>
            Once the form is completed, we analyze your business and local market, structure campaigns based on real searches,
            and prepare messaging and settings. If clarification is needed, we contact you by email.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 4 - Launch and follow-up</h3>
          <p>
            When campaigns are ready, you receive a confirmation email and visibility starts based on agreed parameters.
            A report can cover traffic, conversions, CTR, CPC, CPA, impression share and competitive context.
