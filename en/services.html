          <h2>Visibility that matches demand</h2>
          <p>
            When someone searches on Google or Bing, they already have a specific need.
            They are not browsing. They are comparing. They are deciding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our work is not about pushing ads everywhere.
            It’s about showing up when that decision is happening - based on real intent.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            That’s why we focus on search-based visibility only - where demand already exists.

          <h2>The core setup - Google Search Ads</h2>
          <p>
            Your visibility is built using targeted Google Search Ads campaigns.
            This is the foundation of the service and what the initial setup covers.
          </p>
          <p>
            We structure campaigns so that your brand name is protected, your main services are clearly represented,
            and your ads communicate what makes you different.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            Google Ads is not used here to “push” advertising.
            It’s used to show up when the intent already exists.
