      <h2>What does “search-first visibility” mean?</h2>
      <p>
        It means focusing on appearing when people actively search, instead of interrupting them with ads or generic messaging.
      </p>

      <h2>Is this SEO or advertising?</h2>
      <p>
        It is search visibility. It can include SEO, but the goal is presence at the moment of intent, not traffic for traffic’s sake.
      </p>

      <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
      <p>
        This approach is for businesses that want qualified demand, not mass exposure.
