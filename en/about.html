      <h2>How we operate</h2>

      <p>
        Visible at Search is a Canada-based SEM service focused on Google Ads, built to deliver accessible and affordable search marketing without compromising on execution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our team has managed over $1M per year in Google Ads budgets and worked within structured, performance-driven environments. That experience defines how we operate today: disciplined setups, clear priorities, and solutions designed to perform in competitive environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Visible at Search was created to bring professional-grade search marketing to smaller businesses and independent professionals - the same foundations used by larger organizations, adapted to realistic budgets and simpler needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        To support this approach, we operate with a lean structure.
      </p>

      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>No sales consultants.</li>
        <li>No intermediary account managers.</li>
        <li>No unnecessary layers.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This keeps costs down and ensures decisions stay in the hands of the person doing the work.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal is simple: provide a reliable, affordable entry point into search marketing, with systems built to scale as the business grows.
      </p>
