          <h3>Step 2 - Startup form</h3>
          <p>
            The email includes a link to a short startup form you can complete at your own pace.
            We ask for your business name, services offered, target area, and priorities (calls, forms, emails).
          </p>

          <h3>Step 3 - Analysis and setup</h3>
          <p>
            Once the form is completed, we analyze your business and local market, structure campaigns based on real searches,
            and prepare messaging and settings. If clarification is needed, we contact you by email.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 4 - Launch and follow-up</h3>
          <p>
            When campaigns are ready, you receive a confirmation email and visibility starts based on agreed parameters.
            A report can cover traffic, conversions, CTR, CPC, CPA, impression share and competitive context.
